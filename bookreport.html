<h1 id="heading">JavaScript</h1>
<p>Hello, and welcome to our book report.</p>
<p>Last time you learned about HTML &amp; CSS.</p>
<p>Today we will be teaching you about JavaScript.</p>
<p>The book is called JavaScript &amp; JQuery. </p>
<p>We will only be teaching you JavaScript though.</p>
<p>Eli and I will teach you about those things, so here is the things we have been working on!</p>
<p>We are going to tell you the basics on doing the things.</p>
<p>First of all, JavaScript is not the same thing as Java.</p>
<p>He’s right. Java is 10&times; harder.</p>
<p>JavaScript is a programing language much, much, easier than Java.</p>
<p>JavaScript is used to add behavior to websites.</p>
<p>If you don’t know about HTML or CSS you won't be able to use JavaScript.</p>
<p>That is the whole point of JavaScript.</p>
<p>Go onto GitHub.com with your parents and an email to get an account.</p>
<p>This thing helps us make our website more customizable without some lame site editor.</p>
<p>Eli and I are making this website just for this book report, but you can make websites for legit things like games (ex. Cookie Clicker).</p>
<p>Games are fun, but some need a challenge.</p>
<p>But if you want a challenge, you should learn how to program</p>
<p>So now we will teach you JavaScript!.</p>
<p>First you must let the computer know where you want to change stuff.</p>
<p>Do this by typing- var VAR-HERE = document.getElementById('ID-HERE');.</p>
<p>Then to change the text in it type VAR-HERE.textContent = "NEW TEXT HERE".</p>
<p>But you can't do any of that unless you link your HTML to you JavaScript.</p>
<p>Put the following line of code into your html- &lt;script src="main.js" /&gt;.</p>
