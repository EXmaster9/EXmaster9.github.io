<p>Hello, and welcome to our book report.</p>
<p>Last time you learned about HTML &amp; CSS.</p>
<p>Today we will be teaching you about JavaScript.</p>
<p>The book is called JavaScript &amp; JQuery. </p>
<p>We will only be teaching you JavaScript though.</p>
<p>Eli and I will teach you about those things, so here is the things we have been working on!</p>
<p>We are going to tell you the basics on doing the things.</p>
<p>First of all, JavaScript is not the same thing as Java.</p>
<p>He’s right. Java is 10&times; harder</p>
<p>JavaScript is a programing language much, much, easier than Java.</p>
<p>[Eli] JavaScript is used to add behavior to websites.</p>
<p>[Jakob] If you don’t know about HTML or CSS you won't be able to use JavaScript
<p>[Eli] That is the whole point of JavaScript.</p>
<p>[Jakob] Go onto GitHub.com with your parents and an email to get an account.</p>
<p>[Eli] This thing helps us make our website more customizable without some lame site editor.</p>
<p>[Jakob] Eli and I are making this website just for this book report, but you can make websites for legit things like games (ex. Cookie Clicker)</p>
<p>[Eli] Games are fun, but some need a challenge.</p>
<p>[Jakob] But if you want a challenge, you should learn how to program
<p>[Eli] So now we will teach you JavaScript!</p>
<p>[Jakob] First you must let the computer know where you want to change stuff</p>
 <p>[Eli]then you have to do what you need and you will be fine</p>
 <p>[Jakob]images help because then you are not just putting words on everything</p>
 <p>[Eli]dont get to exited with the pictures or you might get overloaded</p>
 <p>[Jakob]we like GitHub because it is a more effective</p>
