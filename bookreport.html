<p>Hello and welcome to my book report! Today I will be teaching you all HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) and CSS 
(Cascading Style Sheets). The first thing that everyone should know is every HTML (NOT CSS) tag has a less 
than sign (<) and then the name of the tag (ex. "p") and then a greater than sign (>). The most used tag is "p".
"p" is used when typing text to show on the website (I used it to make this paragraph). Speaking of paragraph who can guess 
what "p" stands for?? CORRECT!!! Are you wondering how to close the paragraph?? 
Add a slash before the tag (ex. &lt;p&gt;I LIKE TACOZ!!!!&lt;/p&gt;).
</p>
<p>I forgot to mention, in HTML you should always start your code with &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; and there is no 
ending tag. Some more things you should always have in your code are &lt;html&gt;, &lt;/html&gt;, &lt;head&gt;, 
&lt;/head&gt;, &lt;body&gt;, and &lt;/body&gt;. Some more very useful tags are &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, &lt;h3&gt;, 
&lt;h4&gt;, &lt;h5&gt;, and &lt;h6&gt;. They are used for <h1>Headings</h1>. H1 is the biggest and h6 is the smallest. 
<h1>h1</h1>
<h2>h2</h2>
<h3>h3</h3>
<h4>h4</h4>
<h5>h5</h5>
<h6>h6</h6>
